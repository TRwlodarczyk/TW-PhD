### Leaseweb hosting

This website is hosted on Leaseweb servers. CloudCannon is used as external CMS. No traffic or visitor data ends up at CloudCannon or their partners. Leaseweb, however, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Leaseweb is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a derective of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from 2018 on how to legally use Google Analytics without explicit consent.

### Crisp Chat

The chat module in the bottom right corner uses Crisp Chat and upon loading that module, your visitor data is sent to Crisp Chat. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts.
