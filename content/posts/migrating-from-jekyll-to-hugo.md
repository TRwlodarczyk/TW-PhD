title: Migrating from Jekyll to Hugo

Let me be honest. Migrating from Jekyll to Hugo was not as easy as I thought. 

The first problem was understanding the folder structure. The Hugo manual was not very clear about the best practise. I have figured out that you need at least three files. You need an 'index.html' for the front page which you should place in your 'layouts' folder. Additionally you need a '_default' folder with a 'single.html' and a 'list.html' file in it. Their name tells you what they do: listing the content of a specific content type (section) and displaying a single content file. If you want an alternative list template for 'posts' (or any other content type, called 'section'), just create a folder next to your '_default' folder with the name of your content type, in this case 'posts'. 

The second problem was the Go templating language. It is not very straight forward and the documentation is limited. For example, I could not find a basic `if else` statement, like this: `{{ if gt (len . ) 0 }}`, which appears to be valid. The dot here refers to the item in the loop, which is also not clearly explained in the docs. The possible combination of `if` and `gt` (greater than) is also not mentioned. I had to find this in code from people in the community. To understand the Go templating language, you have to know that the function always comes first. The example `{{ if gt (len . ) 0 }}` litteraly means 'if | greater than | length of the current item | zero'. You have to understand this means 'if the length of the current item is greater than zero'. From a language/grammer point this is not very logical. It takes a while to get used to this notation.

The third problem was Forestry.io. I had been using CloudCannon with Jekyll and I turned out to be spoiled. Forestry has some very specific ideas about how my markdown should be formatted. Not following the code-style they preferred lead to unwanted updates of my code, resulting in an extra pull and merge for every push I did. Their updates broke my code more than once, because they had problems with parsing big inline SVG files too. Using Forestry feels like working with a stubborn co-worker. We had to get used to each others quirks.
