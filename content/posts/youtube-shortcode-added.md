I added a brand new 'add-on': a GDPR compliant way to [add Youtube to your Hugo website](/add-ons/youtube-shortcode/) using a shortcode. It is inspired by the code of Paul Irish. Installation is super simple. I even base64 encoded the images for you. All you need to do is put the [Youtube shortcode](/add-ons/youtube-shortcode/) in your shortcodes directory and you are good to go! 

Happy coding!
