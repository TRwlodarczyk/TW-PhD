title: Getting started
---

I have a very strong opinion when it comes to learning Hugo (or anything in general): start from scratch. I feel that that is the only way to fully understand how it works. It may feel slow in the beginning, but you will fully understand it in the end. I have created a series of steps (or lessons), called 'Getting started with Hugo'. They cover the absolute basics. I have outlined them below.

Note that I have deliberately chosen not to explain every principle behind Hugo. This is 'Hugo by example'.
