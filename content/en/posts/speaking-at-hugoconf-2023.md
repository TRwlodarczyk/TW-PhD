It has been an honor to speak at HugoConf 2023. My talk was about Hugobricks, a theme/concept for stackable content blocks in Hugo. If you want to see my 7 minute (pre-recorded) talk, check it out on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/862118474/865457fbbf) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BusNdoZNVRk).

This was my third conference talk. I have also been presenting at [JekyllConf 2019](https://www.usecue.com/blog/speaking-at-jekyllconf-2019/) and [HugoConf 2022](https://hugocodex.org/blog/resize-all-images/). I was accompanied by some great speakers, like Joe Mooring (famous in the Hugo community for his excellent support). He talked about contributing to open-source. [His talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRDrL0NcAg) was my personal favorite. I also really liked [the talk of Christian Oliff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBSOTAOA-LY) about render hooks, as well as [the talk from Liam Bigelow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgoBoX4qTk8) about Pagefind. If you want to be astonished by numbers and magnitude, I recommend [the talk of John Phamvan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OiU3N2Ps9g), who spoke about a Hugo website with 4 million pages. Finally, for anyone who has ever migrated a website to Hugo: you must [watch George Phillips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlJkQEC2LNQ) with his mind blowing automatic migration concept.

I hope you will enjoy [all these talks](https://hugoconf.io/) as much as I did. Enjoy!
