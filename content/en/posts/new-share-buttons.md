Thanks to [Guus Groenink](https://github.com/itsguus) we now have brand new share buttons. I have been working with Guus for quite some time now and the guy is Hugo KING! He builds Hugo websites on a daily basis for [Omelette Du Fromage](https://www.omelettedufromage.nl/) (an advertising agency). You can see the new buttons in action in our [new webshop](/blog/hugo-webshop-ported-from-jekyll/) (ported from Jekyll by Fenix) and under every blog post. The share buttons can share to different modern networks, it has embedded (inline) SVG's and it even has a neat config part in the top of the partial. Check it out for yourself in the [Add-ons](/add-ons/) section!
