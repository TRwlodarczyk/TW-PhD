title: Instagram solution broken
date: 2023-02-17

We promoted Profile Page Images on this website, which relied on an integration with the Instagram API. Yesterday the people at Meta decided to disable this integration, because they could not login and find the integration that we were using. We are talking about an integration more than 200 of you apparently had found easily and were using happily (as I can see from the massive amount of bandwidth usage). Note that I was happily providing this tracking-free bandwidth. Privacy is something I value very much.

Read more about on the [Usecue blog](https://www.usecue.com/blog/profilepageimages-disabled-by-facebook/). Please look around for alternatives, as there is currently little we can do to fix this. With great power comes great responsibility... but not at Meta/Facebook. Awful!
