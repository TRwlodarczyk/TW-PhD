title: Getting started
---

This is a lesson series that shows you how Hugo works from scratch (pun intended). This means that you will start with absolutely nothing and build your way to a full-fledged website. Lessons are short simple to follow. The lessons teach limited theoretical background. The series has a strong focus on 'learning by doing'.
