title: 1. Install Hugo
---

There are [many ways](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) to install Hugo. The best thing about Hugo is that installing is/can be very simple. It basically all comes down to the same thing:

On Windows you should download the Windows version (tar.gz), uninstall it in your project folder and run 'hugo server' from the command line. On a Mac you should download the MacOS version (tar.gz), uninstall it in your project folder and run 'hugo server' from the command line. On a Linux machine you should install Hugo by typing 'sudo apt install hugo'. Then go to your project folder and run 'hugo server' from the command line. If you want the latest version you can download the .deb file and install it with the same command (replace 'hugo' with the name of your .deb file).
